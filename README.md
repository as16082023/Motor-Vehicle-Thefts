# Motor-Vehicle-Theft Analysis
 This project analyzes vehicle theft data from New Zealand to identify patterns and provide actionable insights to aid in public awareness and crime prevention. Using MySQL, examined six months of data to uncover trends related to timing, locations, and vehicle types commonly targeted by thieves. The findings aim to support the New Zealand Police Departmentâ€™s efforts to reduce vehicle theft incidents by raising community awareness and guiding preventive measures.

 # Insights:
 -  A total of 4,553 vehicle thefts were reported, with a gradual increase in monthly rates.
 -  Mondays and Tuesdays recorded the highest number of thefts.
 -  Auckland reported the most thefts, aligning with its high population density, while Southland, with the lowest density, experienced fewer incidents.
 -  Station wagons, saloons, and hatchbacks were the most frequently stolen vehicle types.
 -  Silver was the most common color among stolen vehicles, followed by white and black.
 -  Convertibles were the most targeted among luxury vehicles.

# Recommendations:
 - Increase police surveillance on Mondays and Tuesdays, particularly in high-theft regions like Auckland.
 - Raise awareness for silver, white, and black vehicle owners to adopt safety practices, like parking in well-lit areas.
 - Encourage the adoption of new technology and require all vehicles to have real-time GPS tracking installed.
 - Set up watch programs that focus on keeping vehicles safe, encouraging residents to report any suspicious activity. This can build community awareness and help lower theft rates.
 - Encourage vehicle owners to add anti-theft devices or tracking systems.
 - Increase awareness in high-risk areas.
 - Promote secure parking initiatives in high-risk areas by providing subsidized parking options with added security features, such as surveillance cameras and gated access.
